_"Of course,"_ she whispered. Then, she shouted: "All I need is **a little moxie!"**
If you're thinking to yourself, **_This is unbelievable_**, you'd probably be right.

I read this interesting quote the other day:

> "Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"

>Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...
>
>His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.
>
>He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.
>He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to jibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: _VIVE L'IRLANDE_!
* Flour 
* Cheese  
* Tomatoes
1. Cut the cheese
2. Slice the tomatoes
3. Rub the tomatoes in flour
* Azalea (_Ericaceae Rhododendron_)
* Chrysanthemum (_Anthemideae Chrysanthemum_)
* Dahlia (_Coreopsideae Dahlia_)
* Calculus, 
    * A professor
    * Has no hair 
    * Often wears green
* Castafiore
    * An opera singer 
    * Has white hair 
    * Is possibly mentally unwell
    1. Cut the cheese
 
 Make sure that the cheese is cut into little triangles.

2. Slice the tomatoes

   Be careful when holding the knife.
   For more help on tomato slicing, see Thomas Jefferson's seminal essay _Tom Ate Those_.  
   We pictured the meek mild creatures where  
They dwelt in their strawy pen,  
Nor did it occur to one of us there  
To doubt they were kneeling then.  
1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.  
Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.  
If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.  
Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!  

## Exercise 2

### HTML
 (_lyhenne sanoista Hypertext Markup Language_, suomennettuna hypertekstin merkintäkieli) on avoimesti standardoitu merkintäkieli, jolla voidaan kuvata hyperlinkkejä sisältävää tekstiä eli hypertekstiä. HTML:llä voidaan myös merkitä tekstin rakenne eli esimerkiksi, mikä osa tekstistä on otsikkoa ja mikä leipätekstiä. HTML tunnetaan erityisesti kielenä, jolla internetsivut on kirjoitettu.

### XML
 (_Extensible Markup Language_) on merkintäkielien standardi, joka määrittää tietojen merkintämuodon loogisella rakenteella. XML-kieliä käytetään sekä formaattina tiedonvälitykseen järjestelmien välillä että tiedostomuotona dokumenttien tallentamiseen. XML-kieli on rakenteellinen kuvauskieli, joka auttaa jäsentämään laajoja tietomassoja selkeämmin. XML:n kehittäjä on World Wide Web Consortium.
